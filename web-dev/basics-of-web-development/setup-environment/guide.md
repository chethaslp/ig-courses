# Environment Setup

## Installation

To get started with web development, you need a code editor. We recommend Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

### Step 1: Download VS Code
Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website:
[https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Step 2: Install Extensions
Extensions add extra functionality to VS Code. We recommend the following:

1.  Open VS Code.
2.  Click on the **Extensions** icon in the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3.  Search for and install:
    *   **Live Server**: Launches a local development server with live reload feature.
    *   **Save Typing**: (Optional) Helps with auto-completion.

Once installed, you are ready to write your first line of code!
