# Handling Requests and Responses

## Objective
Learn how to parse incoming data and send appropriate responses.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Middleware
Use middleware (like `express.json()`) to parse JSON bodies in POST requests.

### Step 2: Status Codes
Send different HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 400 for bad request) based on the input.
