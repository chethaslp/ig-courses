# Basic Arithmetic and String Operations

## Objective
Learn how to perform operations with numbers and manipulate strings in JavaScript.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Arithmetic Operations
Write JavaScript code to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using two variables.

### Step 2: String Operations
Practice string operations, like concatenation (`+`), `toUpperCase()`, and `toLowerCase()`.

**Example:**
```javascript
let greeting = "Hello";
let name = "Chethas";
let fullGreeting = greeting + " " + name + "!";
console.log(fullGreeting.toUpperCase());
```
