# Building a Simple API with Express

## Objective
Create API endpoints to handle GET and POST requests.

## Instructions

### Step 1: GET Route
Create a GET route (e.g., `/api/message`) that returns a JSON object with a welcome message.

### Step 2: POST Route
Create a POST route (e.g., `/api/data`) that accepts JSON data and logs it to the console.

### Step 3: Test
Test your API using Postman or your browser.
